# Chapter 30: Subsampling Optimization

Welcome to the chapter 30 of our book on Machine Learning Optimizers! In the previous chapter, we learned about the Armijo-Goldstein Condition which is one of the important line search optimization techniques in the gradient descent algorithm. 

In this chapter, we will explore another useful technique in optimization called Subsampling. It is a powerful technique that can help speed up large scale computations and relieve some of the memory burden involved in processing large data sets. Subsampling optimization allows us to estimate the gradient of the objective function using only a small subset of the training data, rather than the entire dataset. This technique is particularly useful when working with large datasets where computing the full gradient is impractical due to time and memory constraints.

Subsampling optimization has been widely studied in the literature and has been shown to work well for different types of machine learning problems including classification and regression tasks. Several different algorithms have been proposed that use subsampling techniques, including stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and variance reduced stochastic gradient descent.

In this chapter, we will discuss the theory behind subsampling optimization and how to apply it to various optimization algorithms. We will also explore some of the benefits and drawbacks of using subsampling techniques, along with some practical tips for making the most of this approach. Finally, we will provide some code examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of subsampling in optimizing machine learning models.

So buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of subsampling optimization in machine learning!
# The Wizard of Oz and Subsampling Optimization

Once upon a time in the land of Machine Learning, a young girl named Dorothy set out on a journey to find the Great Wizard of Oz, who was rumored to have the power to optimize any machine learning model. Along the way, she met a Scarecrow who wished to optimize his neural network and a Tin Man who was searching for the best hyperparameters for his decision tree.

As they ventured through the dense forest, they came upon a group of monkeys who were attempting to optimize a large-scale convolutional neural network. The monkeys were struggling to compute the full gradient of the objective function, as their dataset was too large to fit into their memory.

Dorothy remembered hearing about a technique called subsampling optimization, which allowed estimating the gradient using a subset of the data. She knew this technique could help the monkeys optimize their model more efficiently. She explained the concept to the monkeys and helped them apply it to their neural network.

Using subsampling optimization, the monkeys were able to estimate the gradient accurately and speed up their computations significantly. They were amazed by how well the technique worked and grateful to Dorothy for her valuable advice.

The Scarecrow and Tin Man were also intrigued by the idea of subsampling optimization and decided to apply it to their models. They found that it not only made their modeling process faster and more efficient, but it also improved their model performance.

As they continued their journey, Dorothy, Scarecrow, and Tin Man realized that the Great Wizard of Oz may not be as powerful as they thought. With subsampling optimization, they were able to optimize their machine learning models faster and more efficiently than ever before.

And so, the lesson was learned: subsampling optimization is a powerful technique that can help optimize machine learning models efficiently, even when dealing with large datasets. It allows us to estimate the gradient using a small subset of the data and can lead to significant gains in both speed and performance.
To implement subsampling optimization in machine learning, we can leverage various optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or mini-batch gradient descent. The following code demonstrates how to use the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm to optimize a simple linear regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset with subsampling.

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

# Load data
data = load_boston()

# Initialize parameters
theta = np.zeros((data.data.shape[1], 1))
learning_rate = 0.01
batch_size = 100
n_epochs = 1000

# Define subsampling function
def subsample(X, y, batch_size):
    sample = np.random.randint(X.shape[0], size=batch_size)
    return X[sample, :], y[sample]

# Implement mini-batch gradient descent with subsampling
for epoch in range(n_epochs):
    X_batch, y_batch = subsample(data.data, data.target.reshape(-1, 1), batch_size)
    gradient = -X_batch.T.dot(y_batch - X_batch.dot(theta))
    theta -= learning_rate * gradient

# Print optimized theta
print(theta)
```

In this code, we first load the Boston Housing Dataset using `load_boston()` from the `sklearn` library. We then initialize the model parameters `theta`, learning rate `learning_rate`, batch size `batch_size`, and the number of epochs `n_epochs`.

Next, we define a function called `subsample()` that will be used to generate a random subset of the training data at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. This function takes in the full dataset `X` and target variable `y`, as well as the desired batch size.

We then implement the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm in a for loop that will run for `n_epochs` iterations. At each iteration, we call the `subsample()` function to generate a random subset of the training data, and we compute the gradient of the objective function using this subset.

Finally, we update the model parameters `theta` using the calculated gradient and the learning rate. After the optimization process is complete, we print the optimized `theta` values.

Using this code, we can apply subsampling optimization to machine learning models and improve their efficiency while still achieving optimal performance.
