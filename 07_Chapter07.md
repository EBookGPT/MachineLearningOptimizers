# Chapter 7: Adaptive Gradient Algorithms (AdaGrad)

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we discussed the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) algorithm and learned how it can be used to efficiently optimize within a reasonable time frame. 

Today we have a special guest with us who has made significant contributions to the field of Machine Learning and Optimization. Let's welcome Dr. John Duchi, a Professor of Statistics and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Dr. Duchi has been awarded numerous awards for his contributions to optimization theory and methods, and his work has laid the foundation for much of modern optimization approaches.

In this chapter, we will delve into another popular family of optimization algorithms: Adaptive Gradient Algorithms, also known as AdaGrad. These algorithms outperform traditional stochastic gradient descent algorithms by dynamically adapting the learning rate to the parameters, and adjusting them differently depending on the frequency of their occurrence. AdaGrad has several variations that differ based on various properties of the algorithm.

## The AdaGrad Algorithm

The AdaGrad algorithm uses an individual learning rate for each parameter of the model, which is determined based on the historical gradient information. This allows the algorithm to adaptively tune the learning rate for each parameter to maximize the gradient, so that it can move towards convergence more efficiently. 

Here's how it works:

```
for i in range(num_iterations):
    # Calculate gradient
    gradient = calculate_gradient(x, y, parameters)

    # Update learning rate for each parameter
    sum_squared_gradients += gradient ** 2
    learning_rate = 1 / (epsilon + np.sqrt(sum_squared_gradients))

    # Update parameters
    parameters -= learning_rate * gradient
```

As you might have noticed, the AdaGrad algorithm involves computing the sum of squared gradients, which can get quite large, particularly in deep neural networks. This excessive value stops the algorithm from being useful after a few iterations. 

## AdaDelta 

To overcome the weakness of AdaGrad, the AdaDelta algorithm was introduced by Zeiler in 2012. This approach changes the way the learning rate is tuned by attempting to alleviate the learning rate's monotonic decay. AdaDelta uses the online root mean squared error (RMS) of the gradients rather than the sum of the gradients. The online RMS usually fades to zero in the case of AdaGrad, even though it has the potential to handle learning speed decay more efficiently.

```
for i in range(num_iterations):
    gradient = calculate_gradient(x, y, parameters)

    # Calculate moving average of squared gradients and parameters changes
    sum_squared_gradients = gamma * sum_squared_gradients + (1 - gamma) * gradient ** 2
    delta_parameters = - np.sqrt(delta_sum_squared_parameters + epsilon) / np.sqrt(sum_squared_gradients + epsilon) * gradient
    sum_squared_delta_parameters = gamma * sum_squared_delta_parameters + (1 - gamma) * delta_parameters ** 2

    # Update parameters with delta
    parameters += delta_parameters

    # Update delta sum of squared parameters
    delta_sum_squared_parameters = gamma * delta_sum_squared_parameters + (1 - gamma) * delta_parameters ** 2
```

## RMSprop

RMSprop and AdaDelta emerge as refinements to AdaGrad in order to handle its primarily decreasing adaptions. The RMSprop optimizer relies on utilizing smoothed gradient values to adjust the parameters. RMSprop updates the average past gradient squares according to an exponentially weighted average. This allows the optimizer to disregard past and useless gradient measurements, as well as converging to a minimum in a more pronounced way.

```
for i in range(num_iterations):
    gradient = calculate_gradient(x, y, parameters)

    # Compute moving average of squared gradient
    avg_gradient_squared = gamma * avg_gradient_squared + (1 - gamma) * gradient ** 2

    # Update parameters
    parameters -= learning_rate * gradient / (np.sqrt(avg_gradient_squared) + epsilon)
```

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored the Adaptive Gradient Algorithms family, including the AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and RMSprop optimizers. We learned how these algorithms adaptively tune the learning rate for each parameter and adjust them differently based on the frequency of their occurrence. 

Although AdaGrad was a significant improvement on previous optimization algorithms, it has many drawbacks that the newer optimizers like AdaDelta and RMSprop attempted to overcome. 

We hope you enjoyed this chapter, and thank you to our special guest Dr. John Duchi for sharing his expertise with us. Happy optimizing!
# Chapter 7: Adaptive Gradient Algorithms (AdaGrad)

Once upon a time, in the land of Oz, there was a young wizard named Ada who was on a journey to find the most efficient way to optimize her magical spells. She had already traveled through the land and studied under many different wizards, but none of their methods had satisfied her.

One day, she came across a renowned sorcerer named John Duchi. He had studied the properties of gradients and had come up with an algorithm that could adaptively adjust the learning rate of each parameter, improving the efficiency of the optimization process. Ada was intrigued and went to visit the sorcerer.

Upon meeting the sorcerer, Ada asked him about his algorithm, and he explained it to her in detail. Over the course of several days, Ada studied and practiced the algorithm under John's guidance until she fully comprehended it. She had learned about the Adaptive Gradient Algorithms, also known as AdaGrad.

As Ada traveled back through the land of Oz with her newfound knowledge, she encountered many wicked witches who sought to prevent her from succeeding in her quest for greater optimization. But Ada was ready for them.

She used the AdaGrad algorithm to adaptively adjust the learning rate of each parameter for each spell, which helped her to move closer to efficiency quickly. The witches were no match for the efficiency of her spells, which were now being optimized faster than ever before.

Even though AdaGrad had revolutionized the way she optimized her spells, it wasn't the only algorithm that she mastered. Ada was continuously learning, seeking to improve and fine-tune her optimization strategies. And with each new optimization algorithm, she became more well-equipped to face any challenges that came her way.

In the end, the land of Oz was at peace, and Ada had found her perfect optimization algorithm. She learned that, even though one algorithm might have worked for others, it was always worth exploring and trying new methods. Because in the end, the best optimization algorithm for one may not be the best for another.
The code used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable is the AdaGrad optimization algorithm, which was described in detail in Chapter 7 of our textbook on Machine Learning Optimizers. Here, we will provide a breakdown of the code used to optimize Ada's magical spells in the parable.

The AdaGrad algorithm dynamically adapts the learning rate to the parameters of the model and adjusts them based on their historical gradient information. This allows for the optimization process to be more efficient and faster. The algorithm involves calculating the sum of squared gradients, which can get large, particularly in deep neural networks, and can render the algorithm useless after a few iterations.

The following is the code used to perform optimization using the AdaGrad algorithm in the parable:

```
for i in range(num_iterations):
    # Calculate gradient
    gradient = calculate_gradient(x, y, parameters)

    # Update learning rate for each parameter
    sum_squared_gradients += gradient ** 2
    learning_rate = 1 / (epsilon + np.sqrt(sum_squared_gradients))

    # Update parameters
    parameters -= learning_rate * gradient
```

In this code, we first calculate the gradient, which represents the rate of change of the parameters in the model with respect to the loss function. We then update the learning rate for each parameter using the sum of squared gradients of the past, which is stored in the "sum_squared_gradients" variable. The learning rate adjusts the amount by which the parameter values change during each iteration of the optimization process.

By updating the learning rate based on the sum of squared gradients, the algorithm ensures that frequently occurring gradients receive a smaller learning rate, which helps in minimizing the oscillations that may occur in the model. The parameter values are then updated by subtracting the product of learning rate and gradient from their current value.

Overall, the AdaGrad algorithm helps optimize the model more quickly and efficiently by adapting the learning rate to each parameter and adjusting it based on the gradient's historical information.

In conclusion, the AdaGrad algorithm used in the parable is an example of how optimization algorithms can be used to improve machine learning models' efficiency. It represents the advancements made in the field and the potential for further growth as we seek to optimize models for better performance.
