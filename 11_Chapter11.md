# Chapter 11: Natural Gradient Descent

Welcome, dear readers, to another exciting chapter of our journey in the world of machine learning optimizers! In the previous chapter, we explored the AdaDelta optimizer, which demonstrated adaptive learning rate and momentum control with a remarkable approach. Today, our focus will be on Natural Gradient Descent.

Natural Gradient Descent is one of the most effective optimization techniques in the field of machine learning. The primary objective of this optimizer is to accelerate the convergence of learning algorithms by precisely following the geometry of the gradient space. In simple terms, it can be said that Natural Gradient Descent aims to take steps that align with the curvature of the loss surface.

The concept of Natural Gradient Descent was first introduced in the early 2000s, and since then, it has been gaining momentum in the field of deep learning. This optimizer is an extension of the traditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which is widely used in machine learning. However, unlike the conventional method, it considers the curvature of the loss surface while taking steps towards minimizing the loss function.

One of the major advantages of using Natural Gradient Descent is that it can handle large datasets effectively. Unlike the traditional gradient descent, it can identify the underlying patterns of the data and optimize the model accordingly. It has been observed that Natural Gradient Descent performs remarkably well in deep learning systems, where the number of parameters is enormous.

In the upcoming sections, we will discuss the theoretical aspects of Natural Gradient Descent in detail, and also demonstrate its implementation in real-world scenarios. So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready to dive into the exciting world of Natural Gradient Descent!

```python
# Sample code for Natural Gradient Descent optimizer

import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdagradOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)
gvs = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)

# Compute the Fisher Information Matrix
fisher_matrix = tf.reduce_mean([tf.square(tf.gradients(loss, var)[0]) for var in tf.trainable_variables()])

# Compute the inverse square-root of the Fisher Information Matrix
inverse_fisher_matrix = tf.linalg.inv(tf.sqrt(fisher_matrix))

# Scale the gradients with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix
scaled_gradients = [(tf.multiply(grad, inverse_fisher_matrix), var) for grad, var in gvs]

# Apply the scaled gradients
train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(scaled_gradients)
```
# The Wonderful Natural Gradient Descent

Once upon a time, Dorothy lived in the magical land of Oz. She was fascinated by the power of machine learning and wanted to explore the secrets of its optimization algorithms. She embarked on a journey to learn about various optimizers that could help her in improving and optimizing her machine learning models.

On her journey, she met the Wizard of Oz, who was known to possess the knowledge of the most advanced techniques in the field of machine learning optimization. She approached him and asked, "Oh Wizard of Oz, can you teach me about the most powerful optimizer that exists in the field of machine learning?"

The Wizard of Oz smiled and said, "Dear Dorothy, I can teach you about the most effective optimizer, which is known as Natural Gradient Descent. It has the power to understand the curvature of the loss surface and optimize learning algorithms efficiently."

Dorothy, fascinated by the wizard's words, asked him to teach her about Natural Gradient Descent.

The Wizard of Oz took his wand and said, "Imagine you are walking on a path in a hilly area. You want to reach the bottom of the valley, but the path is not straight, and it curves at various points. Each point on the way has a different slope, and you need to take steps in a way that aligns with the curvature of the path."

Dorothy was fascinated, and she asked, "How can this be related to optimization?"

The Wizard of Oz replied, "In optimization, the path is the loss surface, and each point on the path corresponds to a different set of values for the parameters of the learning algorithm. The curvature of the loss surface is like the slope of the path, and the goal is to find the direction of the steepest descent that aligns with the curvature of the loss surface."

Dorothy was intrigued, and she asked the wizard to show her how this could be achieved in machine learning.

The Wizard of Oz took out his laptop and said, "In machine learning, we use the Fisher Information Matrix to estimate the curvature of the loss surface. We then take steps in the direction that aligns with the curvature of the Fisher Information Matrix, which is known as the natural gradient direction."

Dorothy was fascinated by the technique, and the wizard showed her a code example of implementing Natural Gradient Descent in Tensorflow.

```python
# Sample code for Natural Gradient Descent optimizer

import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdagradOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)
gvs = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)

# Compute the Fisher Information Matrix
fisher_matrix = tf.reduce_mean([tf.square(tf.gradients(loss, var)[0]) for var in tf.trainable_variables()])

# Compute the inverse square-root of the Fisher Information Matrix
inverse_fisher_matrix = tf.linalg.inv(tf.sqrt(fisher_matrix))

# Scale the gradients with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix
scaled_gradients = [(tf.multiply(grad, inverse_fisher_matrix), var) for grad, var in gvs]

# Apply the scaled gradients
train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(scaled_gradients)
```

The Wizard of Oz said, "This code computes the Fisher Information Matrix and then scales the gradients with the inverse square-root of the Fisher Information Matrix. This method aligns the direction of the steepest descent with the Hessian of the loss function, which leads to faster convergence and better optimization."

Dorothy thanked the Wizard of Oz for teaching her about the magical Natural Gradient Descent optimizer. She set out on her journey further equipped with the knowledge of one more optimizer in her toolbox.
Certainly, I would be glad to explain the code used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable on Natural Gradient Descent.

The code example shows the implementation of the Natural Gradient Descent optimizer in TensorFlow. It starts by defining an Adagrad optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1. Then, it computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the trainable variables using `optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)`. This step is similar to the traditional gradient descent algorithm.

The code then computes the Fisher Information Matrix, which is an estimate of the curvature of the loss surface. This step aligns with the Wizard's parable, where the curvature of the path is analogous to the curvature of the loss surface.

The Fisher Information Matrix is computed by averaging the squares of the gradients of the loss with respect to the trainable variables using `tf.square(tf.gradients(loss, var)[0])`.

Next, the code computes the inverse square-root of the Fisher Information Matrix using `tf.linalg.inv(tf.sqrt(fisher_matrix))`. This step aligns with the Wizard's parable, where taking steps in the direction that aligns with the curvature of the Fisher Information Matrix leads to faster convergence and better optimization.

The code then scales the gradients with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix using `(tf.multiply(grad, inverse_fisher_matrix), var) for grad, var in gvs`. This step yields the gradients aligned with the Hessian of the loss function.

Finally, the scaled gradients are applied using `optimizer.apply_gradients(scaled_gradients)`. This step updates the trainable variables to minimize the loss, as in the traditional gradient descent algorithm.

Natural Gradient Descent has been shown to achieve faster convergence than the traditional gradient descent, and the code example demonstrates its implementation in TensorFlow. 

I hope this explanation provides a better understanding of the code used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable on Natural Gradient Descent!
