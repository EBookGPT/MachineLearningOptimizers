# Introduction to Machine Learning Optimizers

Dear reader,

Machine Learning is often portrayed as a fancy buzzword that solves all problems, but in reality, it is the optimizers behind machine learning algorithms that do the majority of the heavy lifting. These optimizers are essential to ML because they allow us to calculate the optimal values of model parameters given a set of training data. Without them, the algorithms would not be able to learn a suitable mapping from inputs to outputs.

In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of optimizers in machine learning, how they work, and why they are essential. We will also provide examples of commonly used optimizers and explain their strengths and weaknesses.

To help us navigate through this complex world of optimizers, we have invited a special guest, Sebastian Ruder. Ruder is a research scientist in the field of NLP and one of the world's leading experts in optimizers. He has made numerous contributions to the optimization techniques used in neural networks, particularly in the context of natural language processing. His paper "An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms" has been cited over 13,000 times and serves as a go-to resource for anyone interested in this topic.

So without any further ado, join us on this journey through the world of machine learning optimizers, and let's learn from the experts themselves! 

Sincerely,

# The Wizard of Optimizers

Once upon a time, there was a young data scientist named Dorothy who dreamt of building the perfect machine learning model. She knew that optimizing the model's parameters was key to making it work well.

One day, she found herself lost in a dense forest of optimization algorithms, unsure of which path to take. As she wandered around, she stumbled upon a group of experts led by the great Sebastian Ruder. They welcomed her and offered to guide her through the forest, showing her the different optimization techniques available.

First, Sebastian showed her Gradient Descent, an algorithm that leverages the direction of the gradient to iteratively improve the accuracy of the model. It was like using a compass to find her way out of the forest, taking one step at a time in the right direction.

Next, they came across Stochastic Gradient Descent, a more nimble variation of Gradient Descent that can handle large datasets. It was like having a team of trailblazers that used good guesses to find their way when they didn't have an obvious path to follow.

Then, they stumbled upon Batch Gradient Descent, a method that updates model weights only after seeing all the training data. It was like having a birds-eye view of the forest, seeing patterns that were hard to observe from the ground.

As they continued their journey, they discovered other optimization algorithms such as Momentum, Adagrad, and Adam. Each method had its own unique benefits, like taking longer strides when the gradient points in the same direction frequently, automatically adapting the learning rate, and combining the benefits of both Momentum and Adagrad.

Eventually, Dorothy and the experts found their way out of the forest, having learned valuable lessons about the different optimization techniques. They realized that there was no one-size-fits-all optimizer and that each method had its benefits and drawbacks.

With Sebastian's guidance, Dorothy returned to her lab and implemented the different optimization algorithms, testing and comparing their performance until she found the perfect combination of techniques for her machine learning model.

And just like that, with the help of Sebastian and the optimization algorithms, Dorothy's model achieved record-breaking accuracy.

The end.

### Code example:

Here is an example in Python of how you can use the Gradient Descent optimizer with TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))

sgd = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd)
```

In this example, we are using the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and a momentum of 0.9. The optimizer is applied to the compiled model with a categorical cross-entropy loss function.
# Explaining the code used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable

In the Wizard of Optimizers parable, we followed the journey of Dorothy, a data scientist trying to find the best optimization algorithm for her machine learning model. With the help of Sebastian Ruder, she learned about various optimization techniques, including Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent. 

Here, we'll explain the code example provided in Python that demonstrates how to use the Gradient Descent optimizer in TensorFlow to solve a similar problem.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))

sgd = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=sgd)
```

First, we import the TensorFlow library, which provides a user-friendly API for building and training deep learning models. 

Then we define our model using the `Sequential` class. This class allows us to stack layers on top of each other easily. In this example, we define a two-layer neural network with 64 units in the first layer, which uses the ReLU activation function, and 10 units in the second layer, which uses the softmax activation function.

Next, we define the optimizer we want to use for our model. In this case, we use Gradient Descent with momentum, which is defined as `SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)`. `learning_rate` determines the step size, and `momentum` influences how quickly or slowly the optimizer changes direction based on previous steps. 

Finally, we call the `compile` method on our model and specify the loss function, which is categorical cross-entropy in this case. We also pass the optimizer we defined earlier as an argument to `compile`. 

Overall, this code shows how easy it is to implement an optimization algorithm like Gradient Descent in TensorFlow. By experimenting with different optimizers, learning rates, and other hyperparameters, we can find the perfect combination of techniques to solve any machine learning problem.
