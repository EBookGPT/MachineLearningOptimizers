# Chapter 17: The Wizard of Oz Learns the Gauss-Newton Algorithm

Welcome to the exciting world of Machine Learning Optimizers! In the previous chapter we explored the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm and its applications. In this chapter, we will introduce the Gauss-Newton Algorithm and how it can be used to solve nonlinear least squares optimization problems in machine learning.

To help us better understand the Gaussian-Newton Algorithm, we are honored to have a special guest, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, join us. Kaelbling is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and has published numerous papers on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The Gauss-Newton Algorithm is an iterative algorithm that works by finding a sequence of corrections to an initial guess of the solution that reduces the residual sum of squares at each step. This algorithm can be used to solve nonlinear least squares problems, which are commonly encountered in machine learning applications such as parameter estimation, curve fitting, and computer vision.

The core idea of Gauss-Newton Algorithm is to use the Jacobian matrix and the Hessian matrix to approximate the local second-order behavior of the objective function. The algorithm then uses this approximation to determine the direction and step size to update the current solution estimate.

One of the strengths of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm is its ability to converge quickly to a solution. However, its convergence can be affected by the choice of the initial guess as well as the Jacobian and Hessian approximations. These limitations have led to various modifications and extensions of the algorithm.

For example, the Gauss-Newton Algorithm can be combined with the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm to improve its robustness and converge to a global optimum. Researchers have also explored using stochastic variants of the algorithm to handle large-scale datasets with noise and uncertainty.

In the next sections of the chapter, we will dive deeper into how the Gauss-Newton Algorithm works and how it can be used in various machine learning applications. We will also provide Python code examples to help you apply the algorithm in your own projects.

So get ready to put on your ruby slippers and follow us on this journey through the land of machine learning optimizers as we learn how to harness the power of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm!
# The Wizard of Oz Learns the Gauss-Newton Algorithm

Once upon a time in the land of Oz, the Great and Powerful Wizard was tasked with solving a difficult problem. He had to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear function that explained the relationship between two variables.

Thankfully, the Wizard had learned about the Gauss-Newton Algorithm from his friend, Leslie Pack Kaelbling. Kaelbling, a renowned expert in machine learning, suggested that the Gaussian-Newton Algorithm could help the Wizard solve his problem.

The Wizard was intrigued and asked Kaelbling to teach him more about the algorithm. Kaelbling patiently explained that the algorithm was an iterative method for solving nonlinear least squares problems.

To help the Wizard understand the algorithm better, Kaelbling used an analogy. She compared the nonlinear function that the Wizard wanted to estimate to a witch's potion recipe, and the parameters to the ingredients of the potion.

Kaelbling explained that the Gauss-Newton Algorithm works like a sous chef of a witch who is trying to adjust the ingredients of a potion to make it just right. The sous chef takes measurements of the potion's taste and aroma, and then makes adjustments to the ingredients until the potion passes the witch's taste test.

Similarly, the Gauss-Newton Algorithm takes measurements of how well the estimated function fits the target outputs, and then uses these measurements to make adjustments to the parameter values in order to minimize the residual sum of squares.

The Wizard was fascinated by this analogy and asked Kaelbling to show him how the algorithm worked in practice. Kaelbling wrote a small Python script that implemented the Gauss-Newton Algorithm and ran it on the Wizard's dataset.

As the Wizard marveled at the speed with which the algorithm converged to a solution, Kaelbling reminded him that the algorithm's speed and accuracy depended on the quality of the initial guess and the Jacobian and Hessian approximations of the function.

The Wizard was grateful for Kaelbling's guidance and promised to remember the power of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm in his future adventures in machine learning optimization.

And so, the Wizard of Oz and Leslie Pack Kaelbling parted ways, both richer for the experience of having learned and taught the magical powers of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm.
## Python Example of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm
Now, let's dive into how the Gauss-Newton Algorithm works with a Python example. We will use the SciPy optimization library to implement the algorithm and test it on a sample dataset.

### Dataset
We will use the following dataset to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, num=50)
y = 2.0 * np.sin(2.5 * x) + np.random.normal(0.0, 0.5, size=x.shape[0])
```

### Defining the Objective Function
Next, we need to define the objective function that we want to optimize. 

```python
from scipy import optimize

def objective_function(params):
    a, b, c, d = params
    return a * np.sin(b * x + c) + d - y
```

Here, `params` is a vector of our parameters which we want to optimize.

### Computing the Jacobian Matrix
We also need to compute the Jacobian matrix of the objective function. 

```python
def objective_function_derivative(params):
    a, b, c, d = params
    J = np.zeros((x.shape[0], len(params)))
    J[:, 0] = np.sin(b * x + c)
    J[:, 1] = a * x * np.cos(b * x + c)
    J[:, 2] = a * np.cos(b * x + c)
    J[:, 3] = 1
    return J
```

The Jacobian provides the rate of change of the objective function with respect to each parameter.

### Running the Gauss-Newton Algorithm
Now, we can run the Gauss-Newton Algorithm using `scipy.optimize.least_squares()` function. 

```python
# Set initial guess
initial_guess = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0])

# Run the algorithm
result = optimize.least_squares(fun=objective_function, x0=initial_guess,
                                jac=objective_function_derivative, method='lm')

# Print the estimated parameters
print(result.x)
```

Here, we set the initial guess of our parameters and run the algorithm with the `least_squares()` function. We pass in our objective function and its Jacobian as inputs. The `method='lm'` argument specifies that we want to use the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm, which combines the Gauss-Newton and steepest descent algorithms.

After the algorithm has run, we print out the estimated parameters using `result.x`.

### Plotting the Estimated Function
Finally, we can plot the estimated function with the sample data to see how well it fits.

```python
# Plot the estimated function
x_plot = np.linspace(-5, 5, num=100)
y_plot = result.x[0] * np.sin(result.x[1] * x_plot + result.x[2]) + result.x[3]

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='sample data')
plt.plot(x_plot, y_plot, label='estimated function')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code plots the original sample data as points and the estimated function as a curve. The `x_plot` variable is used to generate a smoother curve than the original sample points.

There you have it - a Python implementation of the Gauss-Newton Algorithm! With this knowledge, you can now use the algorithm in your own machine learning optimization problems.
