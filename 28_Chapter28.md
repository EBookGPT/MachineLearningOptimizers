# Chapter 28: Backtracking Line Search

Welcome to the chapter on Backtracking Line Search in our ongoing journey of understanding Machine Learning Optimizers. In the previous chapter, we discussed the Golden Section search algorithm, which is a powerful optimization technique for one-dimensional problems. In this chapter, we will discuss another one-dimensional optimization algorithm known as Backtracking Line Search.

To guide us on this journey, we have a special guest, Jorge Nocedal, who is a prominent researcher in the field of optimization and has extensively worked on the development of optimization algorithms for Machine Learning. He is the developer of many algorithms, including the L-BFGS algorithm, which is widely used in the industry.

Before we dive deep into the details of the Backtracking Line Search algorithm, let's refresh our understanding of the concept of Line Search. A Line Search is a method for finding a line along which a given function f(x) decreases and then moving to a point that satisfies certain criteria. The criteria used to determine the new point vary depending on the algorithm being used.

In Backtracking Line Search, we use an iterative algorithm that starts with a large step size and gradually reduces it until the Armijo condition is satisfied. The Armijo condition is a sufficient condition for a reduction in the function value during the iteration. If the condition is not satisfied, we backtrack and reduce the step size further until the condition is met.

Backtracking Line Search is a popular algorithm due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. It is also widely used for solving optimization problems in Machine Learning. In fact, Backtracking Line Search is used as a line search strategy in many optimization algorithms, including the L-BFGS algorithm.

In the upcoming sections of this chapter, we will discuss the algorithm in detail, including its implementation and a practical example. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Backtracking Line Search compared to other optimization algorithms.

With that being said, let's explore the world of Backtracking Line Search with our special guest, Jorge Nocedal.
# The Wizard of Oz and the Search for Efficiency

Once upon a time, the Wizard of Oz had a problem. His factory for producing ruby slippers was not as efficient as it could be. He had a hunch that the problem was with the line that transported the raw materials into the factory, but he wasn't sure how to optimize it.

So the Wizard set out on a journey to find a solution to his problem. He came across a wise man named Jorge who was well-versed in the art of optimization. After explaining his problem to Jorge, the wise man suggested using the Backtracking Line Search algorithm to improve the efficiency of the line.

The Wizard was unfamiliar with this algorithm, and so Jorge explained it to him. "First, we start with a large step size and gradually reduce it until we reach an acceptable reduction in the function value. We do this by evaluating the Armijo condition at each step. If the condition is met, we have found a good step size, otherwise, we backtrack and reduce it further until we reach a value that satisfies the condition."

The Wizard was amazed by Jorge's knowledge, and the way he explained things in a simple yet effective manner. He immediately implemented the Backtracking Line Search algorithm for his factory, and the results were astonishing. The line was now working at maximum efficiency, and the Wizard was extremely pleased with the outcome.

From that day forward, the Wizard learned the importance of optimization algorithms such as Backtracking Line Search, and he kept a close eye on his factory's performance to ensure that it remained at peak efficiency.

And the moral of the story is that with the help of a wise man like Jorge Nocedal and the Backtracking Line Search algorithm, even a simple problem like optimizing a factory line can be solved efficiently.
To solve the problem that the Wizard of Oz faced in our parable of "The Wizard of Oz and the Search for Efficiency", we can use the Backtracking Line Search algorithm. Here's a code implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def backtracking_line_search(f, gradient_f, x, p, alpha=0.5, beta=0.5, max_iter=100):
    """
    Backtracking line search implementation
    :param f: Objective function
    :param gradient_f: Gradient of objective function
    :param x: Starting point
    :param p: Descent direction
    :param alpha: Initial step size
    :param beta: Backtracking rate
    :param max_iter: Maximum number of iterations
    :return: Best step size
    """
    # Evaluate function at starting point
    f_x = f(x)

    # Initialize step size
    t = alpha

    # Iterate until we find a good step size or reach max_iter
    for i in range(max_iter):
        # Evaluate function and gradient at new point
        x_new = x + t * p
        f_x_new = f(x_new)
        grad_f_x_new = gradient_f(x_new)

        # Evaluate Armijo condition
        if f_x_new <= f_x + beta * t * grad_f_x_new.dot(p):
            return t
        else:
            # Reduce step size
            t = t / 2

    # Return best step size found
    return t
```

Here, the `backtracking_line_search` function takes as input the objective function `f`, the gradient of the objective function `gradient_f`, the starting point `x`, the search direction `p`, and two hyperparameters `alpha` and `beta`, which control the step size and backtracking rate, respectively. The function iteratively reduces the step size using the Armijo condition until it finds a good step size or reaches a maximum number of iterations. The function returns the best step size found.

To use this function to optimize the Wizard's factory production line, we would need to define the objective function and its gradient, as well as the starting point and search direction. The specific implementation details would depend on the problem at hand, but the Backtracking Line Search algorithm could be used as a tool to optimize efficiency.
