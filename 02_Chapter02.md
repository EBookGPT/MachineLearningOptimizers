# Chapter 2: Types of Machine Learning Optimizers

Welcome back! In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of machine learning optimizers and how they can be used to train a model efficiently. However, we only covered the basics. In this chapter, we will go more in-depth and explore different types of optimizers.

As you may have realized, not all optimizers are the same. Depending on the dataset, model architecture, and the problem you are trying to solve, different optimizers may lead to different results. Therefore, it is essential to understand the characteristics of each optimizer to choose the most appropriate one for a given task.

We will start by explaining the four main categories of machine learning optimizers: 

1. Gradient Descent-Based Optimizers
2. Stochastic Optimization Algorithms
3. Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers
4. Second-order Optimization Algorithms

For each of these categories, we will discuss their working principles, advantages, and disadvantages. We will also provide code examples of how to implement these optimizers in Python using popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

But before we dive into each category, let's take a quick break and learn something interesting!

Did you know that the first algorithm for gradient descent optimization was first introduced in 1847 by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, a French mathematician? He was trying to find the minimum point of a quadratic function and came up with a method that closely resembles the gradient descent algorithm we use today. Pretty impressive, right?

Alright, let's get back to business and learn more about these four categories of optimizers.
# Chapter 2: Types of Machine Learning Optimizers

Once again, it's time for a story! Our protagonist this time is Dorothy, a data scientist, who has just landed in the land of Oz. She is seeking help to optimize her machine learning model, which she hopes will improve her research outcomes. However, she has no idea whom to ask for assistance.

As she wanders down the yellow brick road, she meets the Scarecrow, who offers to guide her in the right direction. The Scarecrow tells her that there are four types of machine learning optimizers: gradient descent-based optimizers, stochastic optimization algorithms, adaptive learning rate optimizers, and second-order optimization algorithms.

Dorothy is confused and overwhelmed. She asks the Scarecrow to explain each of these types of optimizers.

The Scarecrow starts with gradient descent-based optimizers, explaining that their primary function is to find the optimal point in the loss function by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases of the model. He tells Dorothy that the most commonly used types of gradient descent-based optimizers are the standard gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and mini-batch gradient descent.

Dorothy nods, but she is still curious about the other types of optimizers. The Scarecrow continues by discussing stochastic optimization algorithms. He explains that stochastic optimization algorithms take a random sample from the dataset and use it to update the model weights and biases. He tells Dorothy that popular stochastic optimization algorithms include Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop).

Dorothy is starting to understand the different types of optimizers. The Scarecrow moves on to adaptive learning rate optimizers, explaining to Dorothy that they adjust the learning rates on the go. He tells her that the most used adaptive learning rate optimizers are Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adamax.

Finally, the Scarecrow tells Dorothy about second-order optimization algorithms. He explains that these algorithms use more information than just the gradient to make updates. They take into account the curvature of the loss function when updating the weights and biases. He tells her that examples of second-order optimization algorithms include Newton's method, quasi-Newton's method, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

Dorothy thanks the Scarecrow for all his help and continues her journey down the yellow brick road. She decides to try each of these optimizers to find out which one works best for her model.

When Dorothy returns to her data science lab, she implements each of the optimizers using Python and compares their performances. After extensive experiments, she determines that Adam optimizer gives her the most accurate and efficient results for her model.

And so, Dorothy learned that there is not a one-size-fits-all optimizer, and she must choose the optimizer that best suits her problem. Her journey helped her gain insight into the different types of machine learning optimizers and how they could improve model training.

Now, let's talk about the code examples used to resolve the Wizard of Oz parable. In the parable, Dorothy learns about the four types of machine learning optimizers and decides to test them using Python. Here, we will provide code snippets for each type of optimizer Dorothy tested.

## Gradient Descent-Based Optimizers

First, let's start with standard gradient descent optimizer code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])

```

Next, let's take a look at stochastic gradient descent optimizer:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

And finally, mini-batch gradient descent optimizer:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Stochastic Optimization Algorithms

Next up, let's look at code examples for stochastic optimization algorithms:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

And let's take a look at the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) optimizer code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

And finally, here is the Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop) optimizer code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001, rho=0.9)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Adaptive Learning Rate Optimizers

Now, let's move on to the adaptive learning rate optimizers:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adagrad(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```


Following is the Adadelta optimizer code:

```

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adadelta(learning_rate=0.01, rho=0.95)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

And finally, here is the Adamax optimizer code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adamax(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Second-order Optimization Algorithms

Last but not least, let's look at second-order optimization algorithms:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adagrad(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

And here's the quasi-Newton's method optimizer code:

```
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.LBFGS()
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer=optimizer,
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
