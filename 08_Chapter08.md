# Chapter 8: RMSprop: Root Mean Square Propagation

Welcome back, fellow machine learning enthusiasts! In the previous chapter, we explored the Adaptive Gradient Algorithms (AdaGrad), which is an optimization algorithm based on adapting the learning rates of different parameters in our model. Now, in this chapter, we will discuss another optimization algorithm that can help us overcome the limitations of AdaGrad.

Introducing RMSprop, which stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. This optimization algorithm was proposed by Geoffrey Hinton in a Coursera lecture in 2012. Compared to AdaGrad, RMSprop uses a moving average of the squared gradient to scale the learning rate. Let's dive deeper to understand the technicalities of this method.

RMSprop is an algorithm that updates the learning rate adaptively for each weight based on the average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight. In other words, it scales the magnitude of the update vector based on the mean of the moment of the square of the previous time steps.

It can be used with different optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other related algorithms. The RMSprop algorithm uses an exponential weighted moving average of squared gradients to adjust the scale of the learning rate. The gradient is divided by the square root of this moving average, so the learning rate is larger when the gradients are small, and it is smaller when the gradients are large.

The RMSprop algorithm has gained popularity in the deep learning community and is widely used in many applications because of its good performance in optimizing deep neural networks.

Now that we have a basic understanding of RMSprop, let's dive into the technical details and implementation of the algorithm.
# The Wonderful Wizard of RMSprop

Once upon a time, there was a young data scientist named Dorothy who dreamed of finding the most efficient way to optimize her machine learning models. One day, she found herself lost in a forest of neural networks, desperately searching for a way out.

As she trudged through the dense foliage, Dorothy came across a scarecrow who seemed to be struggling with a particularly thorny optimization problem.

"Excuse me," said Dorothy. "Can I help you with that?"

"Why, yes please," replied the scarecrow. "I'm trying to optimize this deep neural network, but the learning rate keeps fluctuating and I can't seem to get it right. Do you know of any solution to this?"

Dorothy thought for a moment and said, "I recall hearing of an optimization algorithm called RMSprop that could help you with that. It uses a moving average of the squared gradient to adjust the learning rate adaptively."

"RMSprop?" said the scarecrow quizzically. "That sounds interesting. But how does it work?"

So Dorothy decided to teach the scared and curious scarecrow about the wonderful world of RMSprop through the parable of the Wizard of Oz.

Dorothy explained, "In this story, the Wizard of Oz represents an optimizer in machine learning. He has many tools and strategies to help us optimize our models, but he can be very finicky at times, just like the learning rate in our optimization algorithms."

"And then there's the scarecrow, who represents our deep neural network. He is seeking the knowledge to find the right learning rate to optimize his performance."

"In RMSprop, we take the mean of the squares of the gradients, which represents the knowledge we gathered from our past experience with the optimizer, the Wizard of Oz. This value is then used to adjust the learning rate so that it is neither too small nor too large, but just right, allowing us to converge faster to the optimum."

The scarecrow was thrilled to have learned something new and thanked Dorothy for her valuable insight. From that day on, Dorothy and the scarecrow continued their journey through the forest, arming themselves with the knowledge of RMSprop to conquer all optimization problems that lay ahead.

And so, the power of RMSprop helped the brave duo to optimize their models with ease, making their journey through the forest of neural networks an enjoyable and successful one.
# Implementation of RMSprop Optimization Algorithm

Now that we have learned about the Wizard of Oz parable of RMSprop, let's dive into the implementation of the algorithm in code. 

First, let's define our optimization algorithm using RMSprop:

```python
def rmsprop(params, sqrs, lr, alpha, batch_size, eps):
    for param, sqr in zip(params, sqrs):
        g = param.grad / batch_size
        sqr[:] = alpha * sqr + (1 - alpha) * nd.square(g)
        div = lr * g / nd.sqrt(sqr + eps)
        param[:] = param - div
```

Here, `params` represents the model parameters, `sqrs` represents the moving average of the squared gradients for each parameter, `lr` is the learning rate, `alpha` is the moving average decay rate, `batch_size` is the size of the mini-batch, and `eps` is a small constant to avoid any division by zero errors.

Next, we can use the `rmsprop()` function to optimize our model. Below is an example of how to use RMSprop in Gluon:

```python
import mxnet as mx

# Define the model parameters
w = nd.random.normal(shape=(2, 1))
b = nd.zeros(1)

# Attach gradient to the parameters
w.attach_grad()
b.attach_grad()

# Define the optimizer parameters
sqrs = []
for param in [w, b]:
    sqrs.append(param.zeros_like())

lr = 0.03
batch_size = 10
alpha = 0.9
eps = 1e-6

# Define the loss function
def loss_fn(X, y):
    return nd.mean((nd.dot(X, w) + b - y) ** 2)

# Define the data set
X = nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
y = nd.array([0, -1, -2, -3])

data_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(X, y, batch_size)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 5

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_iter:
        with autograd.record():
            l = loss_fn(batch.data[0], batch.data[1])
        l.backward()
        rmsprop([w, b], sqrs, lr, alpha, batch_size, eps)
        # reset the parameter gradient to zero
        w.grad[:] = 0
        b.grad[:] = 0
        
    train_loss = loss_fn(X, y).mean().asscalar()
    print("Epoch %d, loss %.4f" % (epoch, train_loss))
```

In this example, we use RMSprop to optimize a linear regression model. The `loss_fn()` function calculates the mean squared error between the predicted output and the actual output. The `data_iter` object is an iterator that iterates through the data in mini-batches.

We then use the `rmsprop()` function to optimize the model parameters `w` and `b`. In each iteration, we compute the gradients of the parameters using the `backward()` function, then use the `rmsprop()` function to update the parameters. We reset the parameter gradient to zero after each update using `grad[:] = 0`.

Finally, we print the training loss at the end of each epoch to monitor the progress of the model.

With this implementation of RMSprop, we can now optimize our machine learning models efficiently and effectively just as Dorothy and the scarecrow did in the forest of neural networks.
