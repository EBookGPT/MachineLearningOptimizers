# Chapter 16: Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

In the previous chapter, we learned about Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (NCG), a widely used optimization algorithm for unconstrained nonlinear problems. NCG is an excellent choice when the objective function is smooth, and the gradient information is readily available.

However, sometimes it is not possible to obtain the exact gradient of the objective function, or the function may have a non-smooth or discontinuous nature. In such cases, a different approach is required.

One such algorithm that is commonly used in these scenarios is the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. It is an iterative optimization technique that is used to solve nonlinear least-squares problems. It was first introduced by Kenneth Levenberg in 1944 and then independently rediscovered by Donald Marquardt in 1963.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is widely used in several fields such as computer vision, robotics, and geodesy, among others. The algorithm combines the steepest descent approach with a Gauss-Newton approach that is suitable for problems with a large number of parameters.

In this chapter, we will learn about the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in detail. We will understand the intuition behind the algorithm and how it is used to solve nonlinear least-squares problems. Furthermore, we will implement the algorithm in Python and apply it to a real-world dataset to gain practical knowledge about the algorithm.

So, let's dive in and learn more about the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm!
# The Wizard of Oz: The Search for the Optimal Function

Once upon a time, there was a young data scientist named Dorothy who lived in the Emerald City. She worked on various machine learning problems, and her latest task was to develop a predictive model for stock prices. 

Dorothy spent a lot of time cleaning the data and performing exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns. She finally selected a nonlinear model to fit the data, but the problem was that the model had too many parameters, and obtaining the exact gradient was impossible. 

She asked her mentor, the Good Witch of the North, for help. The Good Witch, who was a proficient data scientist, suggested that Dorothy use the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm to solve this problem.

Dorothy was unfamiliar with this algorithm and asked the Good Witch how it worked. The Good Witch replied, "The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm is like walking between two worlds. On one hand, you take large steps like the steepest descent algorithm, and on the other hand, you take small steps like the Gauss-Newton algorithm. The algorithm paints the right picture of the function as you go through each iteration."

Dorothy wasn't sure what the Good Witch meant, but she decided to try the algorithm anyway. She took a deep breath and began implementing the algorithm for her predictive model. 

The first step was to define the objective function that she wanted to minimize, which was the mean squared error between the predicted and actual stock prices. Dorothy initialized the parameters for the nonlinear model and started iterating through the algorithm.

As she went through each iteration, Dorothy noticed that the algorithm was behaving like a pendulum, swinging back and forth between two extremes. One extreme was where the algorithm took the biggest steps like the steepest descent algorithm, and the other extreme was where the algorithm took the smallest steps like the Gauss-Newton algorithm. 

The algorithm continued to make small, rhythmic adjustments until it found the optimal solution for the problem. Dorothy was amazed by the efficiency of the algorithm and realized how useful it was when the gradient information was not readily available.

She thanked the Good Witch for her wise advice and used the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm for many other machine learning problems. The algorithm had helped her find the optimal solution for difficult problems where other optimization techniques failed.

And thus, Dorothy and the Good Witch had found the optimal function and lived happily ever after.
## Implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm in Python

Now that we have understood the intuition behind the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm, let's see the implementation of this algorithm in Python. In this section, we will apply the algorithm to a real-world dataset to solve a nonlinear least squares problem. 

We will use the SciPy library to implement the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. 

```python
from scipy.optimize import least_squares

# Define objective function
def fun(params, x, y):
    a, b, c = params
    return a*np.exp(-b*x) + c - y

# Initial parameter values
params0 = [1, 1, 1]

# Generate data
x = np.linspace(0, 4, 50)
y = 3*np.exp(-1.5*x) + 1.5*np.random.randn(50)

# Solve least squares problem using Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm
res = least_squares(fun, params0, args=(x, y), method='lm')

# Print optimized parameter values
print(res.x)
```

In this code, we first define the objective function that we want to minimize using the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. In this case, the objective function is a nonlinear model with three parameters: a, b, and c. 

We then initialize the parameter values and generate some data to apply the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The data is created using the same nonlinear model by introducing some random noise.

Finally, we call the SciPy `least_squares` function and pass it the objective function, initial parameter values, data, and the optimization method to use. In this case, we set the method to 'lm' to use the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm.

After the optimization is complete, the algorithm returns the optimized parameter values that minimize the objective function. We print these optimized parameter values using the `res.x` attribute.

And that's how the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm is implemented in Python to solve nonlinear least squares problems.
